## [T]wo-Loop [S]elf-Energy [I]ntegral [L]ibrary

`TSIL` is a library of utilities for the numerical calculation of dimensionally regularized two-loop self-energy integrals. It is written in C, and can be linked to C/C++ and Fortran applications. The authors are [Stephen P. Martin](https://www.niu.edu/spmartin/) and [David G. Robertson](https://physics.nd.edu/people/david-robertson/)). `TSIL` is free software, released under the GPL.

The paper announcing and describing `TSIL` can be downloaded from the arXiv preprint archive as [hep-ph/0501132](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0501132).

The source code for the current version (v1.45, June 18, 2020) of the program can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/davidgrobertson/TSIL/releases/tag/v1.45) as a zip or tar.gz archive. This unpacks into a single directory, which contains the C source files and a README.txt file with complete instructions for building and using TSIL.

<!-- In the Hopi culture indigenous to the American southwest, Tsil is the Chili Pepper Kachina, one of many supernatural spirits represented by masked doll-like figurines and impersonated by ceremonial dancers. Tsil is one of the runner Kachinas. When he overtakes you in a race, he may stuff your mouth with hot chili peppers.-->
